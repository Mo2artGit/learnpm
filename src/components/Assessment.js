          <h4>Why Assessment?</h4>
          <p>
            Today, more and more companies are adopting iterative software design methodologies like
            Agile. Whether you are just starting on this journey or if you already have adopted many agile
            techniques, it’s vitally important to first understand where you are so you know what you need to
            do. As we have done for so many other companies, Learn PM can be your partner in assessing your
            current capability, to help remediate those areas needing correction, and to create a plan for
            upgrading skills on your Agile journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you may find a number of skill surveys online, Learn PM offers six comprehensive Agile skill
            assessments to pinpoint your current capabilities. We drew upon our extensive background in
            software development to create, from scratch, assessments that reflect actual business
            environments. Following your assessment, Learn PM will work with you to provide both
            individualized and customized coaching; Learn PM complements our customized training with a
            number of certification-oriented training programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Learn PM assessments contain both prescriptive and proscriptive components. We can recognize
            those patterns and behaviors in your organization that have you on the right track to improving
            your agility. As experts in agile software development with decades of industry experience in
            business like yours, we can identify those behaviors that you will want to build upon. Equally
            important, our experience as developers and leaders within the software industry will allow us to
            recognize other patterns and behaviors that are detracting from your business and development
            agility.
          </p>
          <h4>What Are The Different Type of Assessment?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li className="fs-5">Leadership Assessment</li>
            <p>
              The effectiveness of Agile development efforts will be either magnified or diminished by your
              organization’s leaders. The Learn PM leadership assessment quantitatively assesses the skills and
              capabilities of your leadership team. As outlined in the Agile Manifesto, the following principles
              are of paramount importance to leaders. First, producing value: does leadership recognize that
              the production of value over the production of features? Second, encouraging change: does
              leadership not only welcome change, and not only encourage change, but actually reward
              change? And third, deliver frequently: does leadership guide the organization to processes
              conducive to continuous improvement and delivery? Learn PM’s leadership assessment
              comprehensively surveys leadership skill in your organization, and it produces recommendations
              to get leadership on the right track to agility.

            </p>
            <li className="fs-5">Organization Assessment</li>
            <p>
              As important as Agile is to your software development teams, many of the same principles apply
              to your organization. The Learn PM Organization Assessment will measure your current capabilities
              as an Agile organization. We will identify those areas where you are on the right track as well as
              those where you are following practices that are counterproductive. Like a tried and true family
              recipe, we have distilled our decades of experience in the software industry to create a
              comprehensive assessment of software development practices. Among others metrics, we assess
              the following key capabilities: value: do each your product releases produce recognizable and
              useful value for the customer; openness to change: are your organizations receptive and
              encouraging of changing requirements, both early and late in the product cycle; and frequent
              deliveries via a continuous improvement and delivery pipeline.
            </p>
            <li className="fs-5">Portfolio Assessment</li>
            <p>
              Rarely does a company produce a single product or feature that is divorced from other
              cooperating products. In an organization with multiple and simultaneous development efforts, a
              siloed approach to product development becomes counterproductive. Do your product teams
              operate independently or is there a cooperative spirit aligning your goals? Is progress gated by
              milestones and measured by the number of tasks completed? Many of the same techniques you
              apply to iterative software development also apply to portfolio management. Our portfolio
              assessment ascertains where you sit on an Agile spectrum and more importantly, what practices
              can you adopt that will bring value, openness to change, and improved delivery to your product
              portfolio.
            </p>
            <li className="fs-5">Program Assessment</li>
            <p>
              The Learn PM program assessment evaluates how well your program development strategy aligns
              with your product portfolio. In an organization with multiple simultaneous development streams,
              cooperation and good intentions alone will not produce intended results. Learn PM measures the
              engagement of program stakeholders and analyzes strategies for predictability and problem
              resolution. Learn PM looks at program planning - is it synchronized with the other programs in your
              enterprise portfolio? The Learn PM program assessment measures the propensity of your program to
              exist cooperatively within the portfolio and deliver value while being open to change.
            </p>
            <li className="fs-5">Team Assessment</li>
            <p>
              There are two important considerations. First, there is no perfect team environment. Second,
              creating an environment where teams can thrive takes a lot of work. The Learn PM Team Assessment
              looks at the makeup and dynamics of an individual agile team. We ascertain to what degree has
              the team jelled or what obstacles may be preventing that from occurring. We look at the team
              dynamics: how much trust is there between team members? Is there a team culture, and if so, is
              the culture beneficial to, or detrimental to, the team’s success? Does the team feel empowered to
              deliver great products? Learn PM’s decades of experience in Agile organizations allows us to
              recognize and assess those aspects of teamwork that encourage producing value, being open to
              change, and allow for continuous improvement and delivery.
            </p>
            <li className="fs-5">Individual Assessment</li>
