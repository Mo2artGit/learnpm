Raj Senapathy is an incredible instructor that brings forth his tacit and explicit knowledge to the course. The tools and knowledge transfer from Raj allowed me to pass this exam on the first attempt! Hats off to the PMTI team!',

Very fun, patient and super knowledgeable. Best part was excellent practice question sets and mock exams that had questions true to the pmi exam. Almost identical in some cases.',
