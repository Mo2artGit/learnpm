                <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your relationship with https://www.LearnPM.com/, products, features, services, websites, and applications (the “Service”) operated by LearnPM, Inc. (“LearnPM,” “us”, “we”, or “our”). Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms and the Privacy Policy. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

                <h3 style={headingStyle}>Purchases</h3>
                <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete. The Service may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third-parties subject to our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

                <h3 style={headingStyle}>Availability, Errors & Inaccuracies</h3>
                <p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other websites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service. We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>

                <h3 style={headingStyle}>Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>Subscription Billing Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or LearnPM cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting LearnPM customer support team. A valid payment method, including credit card, PayPal, or purchase order is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide LearnPM with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize LearnPM to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, LearnPM will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice. Free Trial LearnPM may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”). You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by LearnPM until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected. At any time and without notice, LearnPM reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer. Fee Changes LearnPM in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.   LearnPM will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount. Refunds Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by LearnPM on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of LearnPM.</p>
